# Greedy Algorithms

This is a type of algorithmi in which problems are solved in a piecemeal manner in which each iteration the best piece is taken or used. Greedy algs. are usually used for optimization problems in which the problem can be broken down into pieces in which we can judge each piece then obtain the solution by taking the best piece for each iteration. If a greedy alg. finds the solution then it is generally the most optimal solution as it takes the largest "steps" possible toward the solution in each given iteration.
